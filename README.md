- Out of every row of data within this .csv file, this python program will create dictionary keys of unique candidates and the counties where votes were cast, while counting the number of votes they received.</br>

- Which county had the largest number of votes?
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
